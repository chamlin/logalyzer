# logalyzer

It analyzes MarkLogic error logs (a bit).

Goal:  decent, fast.

  - Can transform log names to consolidate by node name.
  - Granularity by hour, ten minutes, minutes.
  - Junk events by regex.
  - Pretty fast.

# use

Run, options will be shown.

# status

useable, need to redo status output.

# todo

  - redo the stats output for multifile reads

  - faster with classification doing quick word checks?
  - R plots
  - use sar stuff
  - day granularity?  or multiple-hours?
  - event read as more than a single line

  - document:  adding extra events and stats operators
